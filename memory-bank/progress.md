# Project Progress

## Completed
- Initialized memory bank structure
- Created core documentation files
- Documented project brief and requirements
- Defined product context and scope
- Established initial project goals and success criteria
- Outlined system architecture and technical stack
- Defined component relationships and design patterns
- Defined and documented MVP in productContext.md

## In Progress
- Planning technical architecture
- Researching available APIs and data sources
- Setting up development environment
- Defining system requirements
- Preparing for project setup phase

## To Do
1. **Project Setup**
   - Create GitHub repository
   - Set up project structure
   - Initialize development environment
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline

2. **Core Development**
   - Implement data integration layer
   - Build optimization engine
   - Develop device management system
   - Create user interface

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Write unit tests
   - Perform integration testing
   - Conduct end-to-end testing
   - Validate with real devices

4. **Documentation**
   - Create API documentation
   - Write user guides
   - Document installation process
   - Provide development guidelines

## Next Steps
- Implement MVP logic as defined in productContext.md

## Known Issues
- Need to determine specific hackathon timeline
- Need to evaluate and select specific APIs
- Need to define detailed technical requirements
- Need to establish development environment
- Need to identify compatible battery and inverter types
- Need to determine specific optimization algorithms

# [2024-05-10] Virtual Battery & AppDaemon System Updates

- Modular virtual battery system with controller, supporting activation/deactivation and external charge setting.
- Absolute imports used for all AppDaemon apps (e.g., `from virtual_battery import VirtualBattery`).
- Sensor readers (`household_consumption_reader.py`, `pv_production_reader.py`) handle 'unavailable' or non-numeric values gracefully, defaulting to 0.0 W and logging a warning.
- Both readers log their current value every minute, even if unchanged.
- Battery controller auto-turns off and logs when fully charged/discharged; can be set externally via `set_battery_charge()`.
- Debugging: Added logs to `initialize()`, checked app names in `apps.yaml`, and handled app availability.
- Noted that Home Assistant connection errors are unrelated to app logic and are usually transient.
