# Project Progress

## Completed
- Initialized memory bank structure
- Created core documentation files
- Documented project brief and requirements
- Defined product context and scope
- Established initial project goals and success criteria
- Outlined system architecture and technical stack
- Defined component relationships and design patterns

## In Progress
- Planning technical architecture
- Researching available APIs and data sources
- Setting up development environment
- Defining system requirements
- Preparing for project setup phase

## To Do
1. **Project Setup**
   - Create GitHub repository
   - Set up project structure
   - Initialize development environment
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline

2. **Core Development**
   - Implement data integration layer
   - Build optimization engine
   - Develop device management system
   - Create user interface

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Write unit tests
   - Perform integration testing
   - Conduct end-to-end testing
   - Validate with real devices

4. **Documentation**
   - Create API documentation
   - Write user guides
   - Document installation process
   - Provide development guidelines

## Known Issues
- Need to determine specific hackathon timeline
- Need to evaluate and select specific APIs
- Need to define detailed technical requirements
- Need to establish development environment
- Need to identify compatible battery and inverter types
- Need to determine specific optimization algorithms
