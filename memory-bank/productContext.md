# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Small-scale battery storage for plug-in solar systems is not optimized for grid demand. Users charge batteries based on electricity prices rather than grid conditions, possibly overloading the grid at peak solar production times while missing opportunities to use excess renewable energy. There are no dynamic incentives for prosumers to adjust their energy use, leading to inefficiencies in balancing supply and demand.

## Solution Overview
BalkonSolar aims to develop an innovative solution that helps prosumers optimize their energy consumption and feed-in behavior to support grid stability, reduce COâ‚‚ emissions, and maximize financial benefits.

## User Experience Goals
- Simple and intuitive interface for prosumers
- Real-time visibility of energy optimization
- Clear display of financial benefits
- Easy integration with existing systems
- Low-cost implementation
- Accessible open-source solution

## Target Users
- Prosumers (users with solar and storage systems)
- Small-scale solar system owners
- Energy-conscious homeowners
- Grid operators and utilities
- Renewable energy enthusiasts

## Available Resources
- Real-time electricity prices & grid demand APIs
- Weather forecasts for solar power predictions
- Battery & inverter data for energy flow insights
- Smart home hardware (sockets, sensors, tablets, etc.)
