   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Git

2. **Local Development**
   - Clone repository
   - Set up virtual environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure environment variables
   - Run development servers

3. **Testing Environment**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests
   - Performance tests

4. **Local Development Setup for AppDaemon**
   - **Prerequisites:**
     - Python 3.11+
     - Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for local testing)
     - Home Assistant instance running on a Raspberry Pi (in a separate network, connected to the internet)
     - Home Assistant Cloud (Nabu Casa) subscription for secure remote access
     - AppDaemon installed (can be in a virtual environment or container)
   - **Setup Notes:**
     - Home Assistant is not running locally, but on a Raspberry Pi in a different network. Communication is established via Home Assistant Cloud (Nabu Casa), which provides secure remote access.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Ensure your Home Assistant instance is running on the Raspberry Pi and is connected to Home Assistant Cloud (Nabu Casa).
     2. Obtain your Home Assistant Cloud remote URL from the Home Assistant UI (Settings > Home Assistant Cloud > Remote Control).
     3. Install AppDaemon: `pip install appdaemon` (or use Docker)
     4. Configure AppDaemon to connect to Home Assistant Cloud by editing `appdaemon.yaml`:
        ```yaml
        appdaemon:
          latitude: YOUR_LAT
          longitude: YOUR_LONG
          elevation: YOUR_ELEVATION
          time_zone: YOUR_TIMEZONE
        hass:
          url: "https://<your-nabu-casa-remote-url>"
          token: "YOUR_LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN"
        ```
        - Use the Nabu Casa remote URL (e.g., `https://<random-string>.ui.nabu.casa`) as the Home Assistant URL.
        - The long-lived access token must be generated in Home Assistant (Profile > Long-Lived Access Tokens).
     5. Run AppDaemon: `appdaemon -c /path/to/your/appdaemon/config`
     6. Develop and test your automation apps in the `apps/` directory. Changes are picked up automatically.

# MVP Technical Implications

Refer to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) section in productContext.md for the current project focus. The MVP requires:
- Integration with Home Assistant as the main hub for device and sensor data.
- Support for data sources: energy prices, weather forecasts, battery charge/capacity, current energy use, and production.
- Initial implementation of simple rule-based (if-then) logic for optimization, with plans for linear optimization in later stages.
- Hardware interaction for battery charging/discharging, device switching, and signaling.
- User interface to display recommendations, available charge, and algorithmic reasoning.

# AppDaemon â†” Home Assistant Integration

AppDaemon apps can interact with Home Assistant via the HASS plugin. Key capabilities include:

## Reading Entity State
```python
state = self.get_state("sensor.living_room_temperature")
self.log(f"Living room temperature is {state}")
```

## Listening for State Changes
```python
def initialize(self):
    self.listen_state(self.my_callback, "light.living_room")

def my_callback(self, entity, attribute, old, new, kwargs):
    self.log(f"{entity} changed from {old} to {new}")
```

## Calling Services (e.g., turn on a light)
```python
self.call_service("light/turn_on", entity_id="light.living_room")
```

## Setting AppDaemon-only State
```python
self.set_state("sensor.my_virtual_sensor", state="on", attributes={"friendly_name": "My Virtual Sensor"})
```

See the AppDaemon API Reference for more details.

# AppDaemon Posting Data to Custom Dashboard API

AppDaemon apps can send data to external dashboards or services by making HTTP requests (e.g., POST) to a REST API endpoint. This allows for decoupled, real-time updates from Home Assistant to any custom dashboard or service.

## Example: Posting Sensor Data to a Dashboard API
```python
import requests

def state_changed(self, entity, attribute, old, new, kwargs):
    data = {
        "entity_id": entity,
        "old_value": old,
        "new_value": new,
        "timestamp": self.datetime().isoformat()
    }
    try:
        response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/api/update", json=data)
        self.log(f"Posted to dashboard: {data} (status: {response.status_code})")
    except Exception as e:
        self.log(f"Error posting to dashboard: {e}", level="ERROR")
```

**Benefits:**
- Decouples automation logic from the dashboard UI
- Enables real-time updates to any web service or dashboard
- Flexible: can be used for logging, analytics, notifications, etc.
